# Digital-Alarm-Clock-With-Countdown Timer-8051-Microcontroller
## OBJECTIVE:
**What is a Digital Alarm Clock?**

*A digital clock is a one kind of clock used to display the time in the form of digital includes symbols
or numerals. These clocks are frequently connected with electronic drives, but the term
digital refers only to the LCD display, not to the drive mechanism. The digital clock circuit uses
the 50-60hz oscillation of AC power.Most digital alarm clocks display the hour of the day in the
form of 12 hours or 24 hours with an indication of AM or PM.
Digital clocks run with mains electricity and must be reset the time when the power is off. Most
of the clocks donâ€™t have a battery back up, so this will cause to fail to generate an alarm sound at
the fixed time. To overcome this problem, many digital alarm clocks are available to operate with
a battery during the power outage.
8051 Microcontroller based Digital Alarm Clock with LCD Display
The required components of this 8051 microcontroller based digital clock circuit with LCD
display mainly include LCD display, AT89C51 Microcontroller, Preset, piezo buzzer and speaker.
The function of each and every component of this project is discussed below.
Countdown timer
A timer is nothing more than a time counting device fabricated inside the micro controller unit. A
wide range of practical applications require a timer in action. A timer inside a microcontroller
unit aids us in implementing this perfectly. A timer can be used to count the 5 minutes exactly
and the bits that get SET at 5 minutes limit can be used to program the controller to turn OFF
some device(s).
This digital clock Also Display Date, Month and Year.
We can also Adjust the Date and Time According to our convenience..*
